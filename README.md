# Imitation of a human handwriting by a robot


Workflow
A wokflow diagram of a human handriting imitation by a robot is shown in Fig. 1 and
consists of the following four sub-tasks:
1. Aquisition of a human handwriting;
2. Extraction of a human motion (handwriting) trajectory;
3. Learning of the motion trajectory;
4. Imitation of the human handwriting by KUKA LWR robot.

This project was done in groups within an computer science seminar at GÃ¶ttingen University which was organised by Dr. Hans Riegel-Stiftung.
